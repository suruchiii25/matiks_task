      <td>At first with the low amount of reviews I was skeptical, spending more time, looking into the game and playing it, it turns out this game is actually really fun. My favorite game mode is the memory battles. I like how this app gives me the vibes of both Duolingo with their mascot and the streak feature aswell as chess.com with their Elo type ranking system. Very fun game, and I like the features, although idk how they make money because I didn’t get ads.</td>

      <td>This game would be much more fun if it wasn't trying to boost engagement by having people only play against bots, so they feel like they are winning. I don't really mind if that means the queues take longer, or people arent in my exact elo range.\n\nAlso the ranked elo should give you more or less than normal when you first make an account, so it can find your skill level.\n\nThis game also feels like it does steal a lot of assets from duolingo and chess.com which could pose an issue if it becomes big enough.</td>

      <td>The games in the app are fine, they are a nice collection of puzzles for which I had to download about 3 apps on Android. No issues in that department.\n\nWhere it really suck is devs pushing updates regularly to time your gameplay and it’s so frustrating to see it go from good to worse to good to worse. I mean make up your minds guys, it is extremely frustrating when one update allows you to talk and the time doesn’t counts but the next update factors the time doing other things since you started the game and switched to other apps. And then you have people who didn’t update and are using the exploits to complete puzzles impossibly in one second by restarting.\n\nThe timer optimisations and bug fixes are frustrating and if this goes on, I am uninstalling the game. I will not update your app every day because you are incompetent.</td>

      <td>Interesting app with a solid idea and several good features.\n\nI enjoyed it a lot during the first week, but over time the experience started to feel inconsistent. Some opponents play at a competitive level, while many others seem significantly weaker than their ratings, which makes matches less engaging. It also feels like a large proportion of games are against bots, likely due to a limited player base, and this reduces long-term interest.\n\nAdditionally, the app can occasionally become unresponsive, and in a competitive game this can affect match outcomes and be frustrating for players.\n\nWith improvements to matchmaking transparency, bot balancing, and overall responsiveness, this app has strong potential. I’d be happy to revisit it after these issues are addressed.</td>

      <td>I never thought I’d say this, but I’m addicted to a maths app! Matiks has completely transformed how I feel about maths. It used to be something I avoided, but since switching to this app, I’ve actually started loving it. The way Matiks makes learning fun and interactive is incredible – it doesn’t feel like studying at all. Plus, the app’s UI is clean, smooth, and really enjoyable to use. If maths has ever felt boring or difficult to you, give Matiks a try — it might just change everything like it did for me.</td>
