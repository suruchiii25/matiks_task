Where it really suck is devs pushing updates regularly to time your gameplay and it’s so frustrating to see it go from good to worse to good to worse. I mean make up your minds guys, it is extremely frustrating when one update allows you to talk and the time doesn’t counts but the next update factors the time doing other things since you started the game and switched to other apps. And then you have people who didn’t update and are using the exploits to complete puzzles impossibly in one second by restarting.

The timer optimisations and bug fixes are frustrating and if this goes on, I am uninstalling the game. I will not update your app every day because you are incompetent.",1.0,1.18.100,-0.07916666666666668,0.5181471306471307,negative

I enjoyed it a lot during the first week, but over time the experience started to feel inconsistent. Some opponents play at a competitive level, while many others seem significantly weaker than their ratings, which makes matches less engaging. It also feels like a large proportion of games are against bots, likely due to a limited player base, and this reduces long-term interest.

Additionally, the app can occasionally become unresponsive, and in a competitive game this can affect match outcomes and be frustrating for players.

With improvements to matchmaking transparency, bot balancing, and overall responsiveness, this app has strong potential. I’d be happy to revisit it after these issues are addressed.",2.0,1.16.400,0.12316017316017316,0.5218073593073593,positive
