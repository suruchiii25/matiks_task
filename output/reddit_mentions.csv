Finally gained Matiks rating 1600 after playing for so long!,i have been grinding matiks daily for past 6 months started it to just get better at math (left maths after 10th) and do something more productive than just doomscrolling. got addicted with leaderboard and rankings in game (i get a mad dopamine rush everytime i win) and after playing it daily for past 6 months finally got 1600+ rating!!!!!

How I landed an internship at Matiks through Reddit (and genuine curiosity),"So this might sound crazy, but I literally got my internship offer because of my Reddit activity. Here's how it went down:

I discovered Matiks a few months ago and honestly became pretty obsessed with the app. Like....i was using it daily and genuinely loved what they were building. The math problems were actually engaging and I found myself spending way too much time on it lol.

Being the curious person i am...i started digging deeper...i began posting about math problems and the app on various subreddit...not for any personal gain but just because i was genuinely excited about it...i hadd recommend it to people who were looking for math practice apps...share interesting problems i solved...that sort of thing

I also went down a bit of a rabbit hole researching the company checking out their team on Linkedin following their updates on X (twitter) seeing what they were posting on instagram...i was just fascinated by their approach and wanted to understand the people behind the product.

Then one day... out of nowhere,i get this DM: ""Hey, we've noticed your analytical skills and genuine interest in our product. We'd like to offer you a Product and Growth internship position... for that first you'll need to complete a task for us""

I was honestly shocked...apparently they had been monitoring community engagement and noticed my consistent...thoughtful posts about their app and math in general...they said my organic promotion and deep curiosity about their product/team showed exactly the kind of analytical mindset they were looking for

I completed their task (which was actually pretty challenging and fun) and now i am officially their Product and Growth intern!

Key takeaways:
Genuine passion and curiosity really do get noticed
Companies are watching community engagement more than you think  
Sometimes the best opportunities come when you're not even looking for them
Being authentically interested in a product can literally open doors

Has anyone else had unexpected opportunities come from just being genuinely engaged with something they love? Would love to hear similar stories!",Capital_Bug_4252,1747974495.0,60,https://reddit.com/r/indiasocial/comments/1ktaup1/how_i_landed_an_internship_at_matiks_through/,13

"Matiks sent me a cake lol, for 100 days streak!","So this post has been long pending as I've been waiting for the day I hit 100 days on Matiks. I was scrolling LinkedIn when I found the app, (drishtibution), but didn't really download it. However, someone posted a photo of them with cake for 100 day streak, and I was like, I want to do this 😂

In the last 107 days, I've seen this app change so much. I've followed them what they are doing, even used to send them feedbacks on the application. And yeah, it's been fun. My rating has been stable and haven't been able to increase it, but I still don't miss my streak. Fun to hai application. success of matiks feels personal 

It's been nice abhi tak, really want to get something on the 200 streak now, maybe not a cake😂

PS: Matiks team if you're reading this, the old UI was better, new one is bad😭",AccomplishedLie7719,1756459482.0,7,https://reddit.com/r/matiks/comments/1n32ofy/matiks_sent_me_a_cake_lol_for_100_days_streak/,2
Sum of squares,A bit confusing to me. What would be the answer here? How to solve it. Is it sum of the digits after doing 43^2?,notsocazzguy,1765824293.0,13,https://reddit.com/r/matiks/comments/1pnfehh/sum_of_squares/,9
Got so tired of seeing matiks on my twitter and finally gave it a try.,kept seeing matiks on my twitter for weeks and honestly was gonna mute them cause it was getting annoying. finally gave in and downloaded it just to see what the hype was about… and yeah i get it now. it’s like 1 min quick math duels with instant dopamine. I won a few games &amp; started chasing higher rating.  now i’m one of those people flexing my rating too 💀,Solenoidics,1755346540.0,461,https://reddit.com/r/unitedstatesofindia/comments/1mrtki0/got_so_tired_of_seeing_matiks_on_my_twitter_and/,35
