It's the best alternative you can have for scrolling especially if you want to improve in maths and memory. It continuously challenges you to push yourself as the time goes by. The best thing? It's multiplayer. A big thanks to the developers to create such a game where social media apps and brainrot trends! Totally satisfied.</td>

This game rewards experience and matches played over raw speed . Like I personally got a 30+ score and my rating is sub 1200 . Meanwhile there are people with 2500+ ratings but sub 20 scores in individual matches . I believe the game should reward skill more than raw experience as it will make the experience feel more rewarding .</td>
