5,Jee aspirant here. I found out about this app through Instagram. It somehow outperformed my expectations for this game. It's the best alternative you can have for scrolling especially if you want to improve in maths and memory. It continuously challenges you to push yourself as the time goes by. The best thing? It's multiplayer. A big thanks to the developers to create such a game where social media apps and brainrot trends! Totally satisfied.,2026-01-10T23:56:47,1.16.400,Raza Hassan Haidry,24,Google Play
1,I'm giving it one star because i really don't like maths and there is only one game which I like is the tiles game 😀 and all other maths i don't like see the developer should develop and program in such a way thinking of maths players and other players too so that's why and I'm bored of playing the tiles game i really appreciate the game but the problem is with math I'm not topper in maths so the developer could understand my problem and make any new changes thankyou for the app,2026-01-10T23:11:36,1.16.400,Saiganesh Laggani,1,Google Play
4,"The app is fantastic & addictive... well lately, I have noticed that the app takes minutes to load... it keeps showing Initializing & that's almost like forever.

3,"Hey, devs ! I honestly enjoy this game very much . There are so many modes, that freaking detailed analysis and so much more about this . But there is a major issue . This game rewards experience and matches played over raw speed . Like I personally got a 30+ score and my rating is sub 1200 . Meanwhile there are people with 2500+ ratings but sub 20 scores in individual matches . I believe the game should reward skill more than raw experience as it will make the experience feel more rewarding .",2026-01-03T12:12:05,1.15.300,Om Kumar,2,Google Play
